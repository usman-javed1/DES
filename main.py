This includes policy settings that prevent unauthorized people from accessing business or personal information. InfoSec is a growing and evolving field that covers a wide range of fields, from network and infrastructure security to testing and auditing.  Information security protects sensitive information from unauthorized activities, including inspection,modification, recording, and any disruption or destruction. The goal is to ensure the safety and privacy of critical data such as customer account detai ls, financial data or intellectual property.  The consequences of security incidents include theft of private information, data tampering, and data deletio n. Attacks can disrupt work processes and damage a companyâ€™s reputation, and also have a tangible cost.  Organizations must allocate funds for security and ensure that they are ready to detect, respond to, and proactively prevent, attacks such as phishing, malware, viruses, malicious insiders, and ransomware."
